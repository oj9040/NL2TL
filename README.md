# NL2STL
This project is to transform human natural languages into Signal temporal logics (STL). Here in each natural language, the specific atomic proposition (AP) is represented as Prop_1, Prop_2, etc. 
The weight of the trained model can be downloaded at the website https://drive.google.com/file/d/19uiB_2XnnnVmDInaLbQeoZq25ghUdg4D/view?usp=sharing

After downloading both the code and model weights, put the model weights into the directory eng2ltl_weights_11_28_word_infix
