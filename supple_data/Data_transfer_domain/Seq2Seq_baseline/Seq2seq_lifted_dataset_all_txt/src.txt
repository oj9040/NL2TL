Globally , when ( prop_1 ) and ( prop_2 ) , then all of the following conditions hold : the transition action that ( prop_3 ) should get detected eventually at a certain moment after between 5 to 43 time units .


at some time ( prop_1 ) and at any time ( prop_2 )


( prop_1 ) or at any time ( prop_2 )


Whenever ( prop_1 ) remains the same until eventually ( prop_2 ), ( prop_3 ) will happen during the coming 22 to 84 time units.


if whenever ( prop_1 ) , whenever ( prop_2 )


( prop_1 ) or when possible ( prop_2 )


at any time ( prop_1 ) and when possible ( prop_2 )


do not ( prop_1 ) or at some time ( prop_2 )


whenever ( prop_1 ) until when possible ( prop_2 )


If ( prop_2 ) happens and continues until at some point during the 268 to 341 time units ( prop_1 ) happens , then ( prop_3 ) should not happen .


Every time ( prop_1 ) happens, then ( prop_2 ) and ( prop_3 ) will also happen.


In case that ( prop_1 ) , and ( prop_2 ) , then the following condition holds : ( prop_3 ) and ( prop_4 ) .


Every time the transition action ( prop_1 ) happens, the following conditions will be true: ( prop_2 ) will happen without any delay.


For each time instant in the future if ( prop_1 ) and ( prop_3 ) then ( prop_2 ) .


( prop_1 ) or at any time ( prop_2 )


never ( prop_1 ) and when possible ( prop_2 )


While ( prop_1 ) and ( prop_2 ) are happening, the scenario ( prop_3 ) should be observed within the next 16 to 64 time units.


Any of the following should happen: (prop_1) or (prop_4), and (prop_2) or (prop_3) .


( prop_1 ) or ( prop_2 )


whenever ( prop_1 ) and whenever ( prop_2 )


never ( prop_1 ) or ( prop_2 )


It is required that at a certain point after the next 428 time units ( prop_2 ), is equivalent to the scenario in which ( prop_3 ) happens and ( prop_1 ) happens .


( prop_1 ) until when possible ( prop_2 )


If at some point ( prop_3 ) is equivalent to ( prop_2 ) and this scenario continues until ( prop_1 ) is detected , then ( prop_4 ) .


repeatedly ( prop_1 ) or when possible ( prop_2 )


at any time ( prop_1 ) and at some time ( prop_2 )


when whenever ( prop_1 ) , at any time ( prop_2 )


when possible ( prop_1 ) and at any time ( prop_2 )


whenever ( prop_1 ) until ( prop_2 )


at some time ( prop_1 ) and at any time ( prop_2 )


when possible ( prop_1 ) and ( prop_2 )


For all time (prop_1), is equivalent to the scenario that if (prop_2), then (prop_3) .


Either keep (prop_4) equivalent to (prop_2), or do (prop_1) until (prop_3) .


at any time ( prop_1 ) and ( prop_2 )


If (prop_1) then (prop_2), then always (prop_3) .


It is always the case that whenever the event that ( prop_1 ) occurs then the following condition holds : ( prop_2 ) and ( prop_3 ) .


when possible ( prop_1 ) or don't ( prop_2 )


( prop_1 ) and whenever ( prop_2 )


at any time ( prop_1 ) or when possible ( prop_2 )


( prop_1 ) or at any time ( prop_2 )


at any time ( prop_1 ) or ( prop_2 )


at any time ( prop_1 ) can infer that ( prop_2 )


at any time ( prop_1 ) or ( prop_2 )


never ( prop_1 ) and whenever ( prop_2 )


It is always the case that whenever the scenario that ( prop_1 ) does n't happen and ( prop_2 ) then all of the following conditions are true : immediately ( prop_3 ) .


never ( prop_1 ) and ( prop_2 )


at some time ( prop_1 ) and at some time ( prop_2 )


always ( prop_1 ) or ( prop_2 )


when possible ( prop_1 ) until at some time ( prop_2 )


( prop_1 ) or at some time ( prop_2 )


whenever ( prop_1 ) means that at any time ( prop_2 )


If (prop_2), then (prop_3), or else make sure (prop_1) happens .


For every time instant in the next 141 to 489 time units, (prop_2) is true, and if (prop_1) is not true, then (prop_3) is true .


For all time during 237 to 493, ensure that (prop_2) is true, and that (prop_1) is equivalent to (prop_3) .


whenever ( prop_1 ) or at some time ( prop_2 )


( prop_1 ) or always ( prop_2 )


whenever ( prop_1 ) until at some time ( prop_2 )


when possible ( prop_1 ) and whenever ( prop_2 )


If ( prop_3 ) is equivalent to ( prop_2 ) then ( prop_4 ) happens and this scenario will hold until ( prop_1 ) is detected .


At a certain point within the next 122 to 537 time units ( prop_2 ), is equivalent to the scenario in which if ( prop_1 ) then ( prop_3 ) happens .


at any time ( prop_1 ) until ( prop_2 )


whenever ( prop_1 ) or whenever ( prop_2 )


If (prop_1) and (prop_2) are equivalent, then (prop_3) should happen at some point 258 to 596 timesteps later .


at any time ( prop_1 ) or ( prop_2 )


It is necessary that at some point (prop_1) happens, or else if (prop_3) then (prop_2) .


( prop_1 ) or never ( prop_2 )


when possible ( prop_1 ) or ( prop_2 )


Until (prop_1) and (prop_2) occur within 191 to 503 timesteps, make sure (prop_3) does not occur .


at any time ( prop_1 ) or ( prop_2 )


At some point during the 365 to 368 time units , ( prop_2 ) happens , or else ( prop_3 ) or ( prop_1 ) happens .


In case that ( prop_1 ) , or ( prop_2 ) then in response during the subsequent 23 to 66 time units , continuously ( prop_3 ) .


( prop_1 ) and when possible ( prop_2 )


at some time ( prop_1 ) or at any time ( prop_2 )


( prop_1 ) or never ( prop_2 )


( prop_1 ) or ( prop_2 )


when possible ( prop_1 ) and ( prop_2 )


at some time ( prop_1 ) and ( prop_2 )


If (prop_1) and (prop_3) occur, or if (prop_2) happens at some point 378 to 426 time units from now .


Either (prop_4) and (prop_1) happen at the same time, or else (prop_3) happens and continues until at some point during the 484 to 886 time units ( prop_2 ) happens .


when possible ( prop_1 ) or at some time ( prop_2 )


( prop_1 ) or when possible ( prop_2 )


If (prop_3), then do (prop_4); or if (prop_1), then do (prop_2) .


at some time ( prop_1 ) and at any time ( prop_2 )


If (prop_3) is equivalent to (prop_1), then make sure (prop_2) happens within 233 to 376 timesteps .


at any time ( prop_1 ) and ( prop_2 )
